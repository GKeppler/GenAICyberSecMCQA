      "In order not to have to reinvent the wheel, many vendors layered their well-established  controls and automation protocols on top of the TCP or UDP protocol. This way, all  that was necessary to hop onto the IT/OT convergence train was to slap in an IP/TCP/ UDP-capable communications module, and they were set to go. Seeing as most control  systems are modular in nature, whereby the communications devices are separate from  the  central processing unit  ( CPU ) (controller), this was an easy swap. Now, customers  could more easily adapt to a standard that allowed a common set of technologies to wire  up the entire production facility by the same type of wires, switches, and even the same  skill set of the person doing the install.  And this is what many companies literally did--they wired the entire network, stretching  from the production area, up through the offices, over the  Wide Area Network  ( WAN )  up to other plants or a corporate office, and sometimes even all the way onto the internet.  This made it tremendously easy to get data, troubleshoot,  and gain accessibility, but it  also opened up these previously hidden devices and equipment--often running the most  sensitive parts of a business--to attack. Controls and automation devices now have an IP  address; they can be accessed from anywhere because they use the IP protocol, and they  can be easily interpreted because the controls and automation protocols that ride on top of  IP and TCP are just about all cleartext protocols. Have a look at the following screenshot:\n",

      "As the preceding screenshot shows, a Modbus packet (for example) does not hide the  data or function codes it is relaying between nodes. This allows for inspection and  manipulation of the data and function codes. Additionally, with the adoption of the TCP/ IP stack of automation equipment, they now can be targeted by common IT techniques  and tools. \n",

Many companies have, however,  moved away from a flat network connecting every device from all over the organization.  We will discuss this in more detail in a later chapter. If you want to see the inherent insecurity of controls and automation protocols in  action and even play with some attacks yourself, I refer you to  Chapter 2  of this book's  first edition -  Insecure by Inheritance .

      "Welcome to the second edition of  Industrial Cybersecurity . Over the next 24 chapters, we  will discuss the next logical steps after building a secure  Industrial Control System  ( ICS )  environment and defining a comprehensive set of policies, procedures, and standards,  discussed in detail in the first edition.  We are going to start off this second edition with a brief recap of topics and material  that were covered in the first edition of  Industrial Cybersecurity . This has mainly been  added to get you up to speed with the terminologies, technologies, and principles that are  expanded upon throughout the rest of this book. The remainder of the book concentrates  on security monitoring and verification of the ICS security posture and the various tools,  techniques, and activities involved.\n",
      "------------- Summarizing the text chunks...------------\n",
      " As such, we will not cover those topics in much  detail again here as it is expected you have read all about them already or that your organization has  done so too. In addition to the first edition's focus on policies, procedures, standards, and concepts of secure design for ICS, this second edition incorporates a wide range of material related to monitoring and verifying the security posture in an ICS environment, including: *\tThe role of network segmentation within an ICS  architecture. *\tSecurity controls across the OT/IT boundary (OT-IoT) with the emphasis on secure deployment strategies. *\tDifferent types of monitoring to detect abnormal behavior and security incidents. *\tAutomation tools, techniques, and concepts for incident management. This chapter will cover: *\tAn overview of  Industrial Control System architecture (ICS). A modern ICS environment typically consists of one or more centralized supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems connected to various sensor nodes through an industrial communication network that is usually Ethernet based. The SCADA system, together with the communications network and the sensors form a closed loop for automation known as the Industrial Control System Architecture (ICS). Although this architecture has been in use since the 1980s, there have been significant technological changes to better meet today's cybersecurity challenges. Some of these include: *\tMaking ICS systems more open and modular so that new capabilities can be plugged-in without modifying existing infrastructure. This allows organizations to introduce newer tools  for security analysis while retaining legacy functionality, as discussed in Chapter 2 (A Modern Look at the Industrial Control System Architecture).*\tFacilitating remote access for users and systems administration tasks through secure means such as virtual private networks (VPNs),  wireless network connections with authentication mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access. This also enables IT organizations, using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products like routers and switches, to remotely manage the ICS infrastructure without compromising security or operational integrity as described in Chapter 3 (The Industrial Demilitarized Zone).*\tUsing a layered architecture with well defined boundaries between various functional areas for better separation of concerns. This is essential from both cybersecurity and compliance perspectives, given that there may be multiple jurisdictional requirements across industry sectors such as manufacturing,  power generation, healthcare, food processing, etc., which must be satisfied by the organization's ICS environment. Chapter 4 (Designing the Industrial Control System Architecture with Security in Mind) provides a detailed discussion of these changes and how they apply to modern cybersecurity practices . It also includes an overview of different network topologies and architectural styles that can be used for designing secure industrial networks, such as: *\tFiber-Optic Based Network Topologies like Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Ethernet based Modular/IEEE 802.3 , IEEE  1914.2  and RapidIO .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this chapter, we will start by explaining what an Industrial Control System  is, how it came to be and what role it plays in the modern manufacturing environment. We are going to discuss some of its unique characteristics that impact security requirements , such as: *\tHigh availability demands : ICS networks require high levels of uptime with little or no interruption to operations . This means there is typically no downt_time for patching vulnerabilities, and it may be months  or even years between major upgrades. Therefore, implementing security solutions in such an environment requires a focus on risk-based approaches that prioritize mitigations according to their impact on system availability. *\tReal time operations : Industrial processes controlled by ICS are often real-time , which means they need to operate without delay or interruption . This further complicates security solutions, as any disruptions caused by an attack could have catastrophic consequences for both people and equipment. We will also discuss the importance of implementing network segmentation within an ICS environment to enhance overall system resilience against cyberattacks. Network segmentation helps contain potential breaches within isolated subnetworks, preventing them from spreading across the entire infrastructure . This can be achieved through various techniques such as Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), firewalls, and host-based controls like access control lists (ACLs). By defining clear boundaries between different network segments (e.g., SCADA systems, human machine interfaces, field devices) , you ensure that security policies are enforced consistently across the entire ICS infrastructure while still allowing for necessary connectivity when needed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Why is Industrial Cybersecurity important?\n",
      "\n",
      "You may not immediately associate your everyday commutes with technology or cyber security; but consider the fact that 96% of all goods manufactured in the U.S. are produced using ICSs. That means a vast majority of people and organizations have some level of interaction (or reliance on) these systems at work, home, school, healthcare facilities... There is simply no avoiding them! In fact, an estimated 48% of all Americans interact with an ICS on any given day -  whether they realize it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "ICSs and Cyber Security: The Connection  \n",
      "\n",
      "Why should we care about cybersecurity in industrial systems? Firstly, due to the rapid increase in connectivity  between devices across various physical layers (Figure 1.2), ICSs are more prone than ever before to unautran- sished attacks and malicious intervention. Secondly, an attack on one system has the potential to disrupt multiple systems at once as well as those that interact with them  downstream in the network architecture (Figure 1.3). This is called cascading impacts and can have devastating effects not just for a business but also the entire supply chain it serves. As we move into an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure are becoming more severe due to their potential economic and safety implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial Systems as Targets of Cyber Attacks  \n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike most other industries, ICS attacks do not target the financial gain from disruption  alone; instead they have a far-reaching impact on people's lives and national security. Industries such as energy production, transportation systems, healthcare facilities and water treatment plants all use critical infrastructure with high dependence on computerization for their operational effectiveness. These ICS assets can be targeted by cyber criminals due to the ease of accessibility (low physical security), large scale impact  when disrupted or manipulated, and minimal detection capability leading to delayed response measures. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A 2015 incident in Ukraine took down several government buildings for about 24 hours after a hacker group called \"Cyber-Warriors of the Ukrainian People's Self Defense\" carried out an attack on power grid systems by using malware dubbed \"BlackEnergy\".\n",
      "\n",
      "* An unverified report in July 2020 claimed that hackers targeted computerized parts in a South Korean nuclear facility, though no evidence of intrusion was found.\n",
      "\n",
      "* A January 2019 attack on Saudi Arabia's Aramco oil company affected operations and shut down two crude processing units for several days, causing an estimated $5 billion loss (according to some reports). The hackers exploited the company's weaknesses in its cybersecurity infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words: ICS attacks can have devastating consequences not only financially but also socially and environmentally. Even though this threat is well-known, many organizations are still behind on protecting their industrial systems from these types of breaches or fail to realize the importance until it's too late - often with tragic outcomes like the recent Colonial Pipeline disruption in 2021 which left millions without gas and caused significant fuel shortages.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial control systems cybersecurity (ICS) involves protecting critical infrastructure such as power plants, water treatment facilities, transportation networks from cyberattacks that can disrupt or manipulate these systems and the services they provide to society at large.  With increasing reliance on technology-driven solutions in all sectors of the economy - especially those related directly or indirectly with our daily lives - safeguarding industrial control systems has become an essential priority for government agencies, private enterprises alike as well as international bodies tasked to maintain global security standards across nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short: Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity is the application of various techniques and strategies used to protect critical infrastructs from unauthorized access or attacks that could cause service disruption/manipulation, economic harm, social damage, safety concerns etc.\n",

      "\n",
      "As you can see in Figure 1.1, there is a hierarchy within the collection  of elements that make up an ICS and each element performs specific functions or  processes at one layer in the Purdue model. A common misconeption among cybersecurity professionals who do not work with industrial systems on a daily basis, as well as many other individuals who are unfamiliar with this topic (or any technical topic for that matter), is to treat the different elements of an ICS architecture like it's just another computer system. That  misconception couldn't be farther from reality!\n",
      "\n",
      "Those of you who have been exposed to cybersecurity principles, practices, and terminology will understand why this analogy won't work for industrial systems:  the layers within an ICS architecture serve different purposes (i.e., process, transport, application) than what they do in typical IT environments (i.e., network, database, application).\n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial automation devices that are part of a control system   require their own type of cybersecurity measures to be applied and managed for them to operate safely with  proper performance levels while delivering the required services at all times: these cybersecurity requirements  may vary based on the function they perform within the ICS (see Section 6.3), as well as other factors such as regulatory compliance, asset criticality, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general terms and for our purposes here, we can consider that a control system has two types of layers: process and network. Process layer functions include sensor data acquisition; processing tasks performed by controllers and actuators; human-machine interface (HMI) features including operator displays; and reporting functionality in the form of historical log files, alerts, etc. The network layer includes all communication pathways between various devices and interfaces within an ICS environment: physical wiring, wireless links, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Process Layer Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "In a nutshell, this is where the magic happens in any automation control system. Here's a breakdown of process layer functions performed by various components within an ICS architecture:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensors collect data from equipment or the environment and pass it on to  controllers for processing. The data collected may vary depending on what sensors are deployed, but generally you can expect temperature sensors  measuring the temperature inside a furnace; pressure sensors in piping systems that convey liquids (either gases such as natural gas  or liquid commodities like petroleum products); and even video cameras recording events at plant locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controllers receive data from sensors, analyze it using algorithms and firmware to make decisions, execute appropriate actions by sending commands to actuators, and generate human-readable reports for review. Actuators are devices that can change physical properties or states of equipment based on the  instructions they receive; examples include motors for pumps/valves and switches for starting / stopping electrical processes.\n",

      "Within the ICS architecture shown in the preceding screenshot, the following main types  of devices within the three main sections of the architecture can typically be distinguished: *\t The Enterprise Zone is predominantly IT space. Devices, systems, and equipment  typically found here are computer-related, such as servers, workstations, and  laptops, as well as mobile devices such as phones, tablets, handhelds, and others.  These devices are connected together with various Ethernet equipment and media,  including switches, wireless access points, routers, firewalls, and the cables that  connect all of these devices ( Category 6  ( Cat6 )/Cat6e media). *\t The  Industrial Demilitarized Zone  ( IDMZ ) functions as a barrier between  the Enterprise Zone and the Industrial Zone and is typically implemented as a  collection of virtualization hardware, firewalls, and switches.  *\t In the Industrial Zone, we can find a variety of regular off-the-shelf IT equipment,  along with proprietary and specialized hardware that is used to run the production  process. In an upcoming section,  ICS architecture , we will discuss some of the more  common systems that can be found in the Industrial Zone. The ultimate goal of an ICS is to create a product or run a process. This goal is achieved by  implementing distinct functions within the ICS that, when combined, allow for control,  visibility, and management of the production or process control. We will now look at  typical functions found within an ICS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The view function\n",
      "\n",
      "The view function encompasses the ability to watch the current state of the automation  system in real time. This data can be used by operators, supervisors, maintenance  engineers, or other personnel to make business decisions or perform corrective actions.  For example, when an operator sees that the temperature of boiler 1 is getting low, they  might decide to increase the steam supply of the boiler to compensate. The view process is  passive in nature, merely providing the information or \"view\" for a human to react to.\n",
      "\n",
      "8     Introduction and Recap of First Edition\n",
      "\n",
      "The view function is presented in the following diagram:\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1.2 - The view function\n",
      "\n",
      "From a security perspective, if an attacker can manipulate the operator's view of the status  of the control system--or, in other words, can change the values the operator makes  decisions on--the attacker effectively controls the reaction and, therefore, the complete  process. For example, by manipulating the displayed value for the temperature of boiler 1,  an attacker can make the operator think the temperature is too low or too high and have  them act upon manipulated data. \n",
      "\n",
      "The monitor function\n",
      "\n",
      "The monitor function is often part of a control loop, such as the automation behind  keeping a steady level in a tank. The monitor function will keep an eye on a critical value  such as pressure, temperature, and level, comparing the current value against predefined  threshold values, and will alarm or interact depending on the setup of the monitoring  function. A key difference between the view function and the monitor function is in  the determination of deviation. With monitoring functions, this determination is an  automated process, whereas with a view function, that determination is made by a human  looking at the values. The reaction of the monitor function can range from a pop-up alarm  screen to a fully automated system shutdown procedure.\n",

      "What is an ICS?     9\n",

      "The IDMZ contains a single level: level 3.5.  Level 3.5 - The IDMZ As the level number might imply, level 3.5 was added to the model later. It stems from  the efforts taken to create security standards such as the  National Institute of Standards  and Technology  ( NIST ) Cybersecurity Framework and  North American Electric  Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection  ( NERC CIP ). The IDMZ is  an information-sharing layer between the business or IT systems in levels 4 and 5, and  the production or OT systems in levels 3 and below. By preventing direct communication  between IT and OT systems, but rather having a broker service in the IDMZ relay  communications, an extra layer of separation and inspection is added to the overall  architecture. Systems in the lower layers are not being exposed directly to attacks or  compromise. If, at some point, something were to compromise a system in the IDMZ or  above, the IDMZ could be shut down, the compromise contained, and production could  continue.\n",

      "At the heart (or bottom) of the ICS is the Industrial Zone; this is the part of the ICS  environment we are trying to protect by shielding it off from the rest of the world. The  ultimate goal is to have most of the user interactions occurring on the Enterprise network/ zone, where systems can be more easily patched, monitored, and contained. Any traffic,  data, or interactions that need to dribble down to production systems do so via tightly  defined and well-configured methods (broker services--see later) in the IDMZ, and are  shielded from directly manipulating the production and automation systems and devices. The Industrial Zone is depicted in the following diagram:\n",

      "Level 3 - Site Operations Level 3 is where systems reside that support plant-wide control and monitoring functions.  At this level, the operator is interacting with the overall production systems. Think of  centralized control rooms with HMIs and operator terminals that give an overview  of all the systems that run the processes in a plant or facility. The operator uses these  HMI systems to perform tasks such as quality control checks, managing uptime, and  monitoring alarms, events, and trends.  Level 3, Site Operations, is also where the OT systems live that report back to IT systems  in level 4. Systems in lower levels send production data to data collection and aggregation  servers in this level, which can then send the data up to higher levels or can be queried by  systems in higher levels (push versus pull operations). Systems typically found in level 3 include database servers, application servers (web,  report), file servers, Microsoft domain controllers, HMI servers, engineering workstations,  and so on. These types of systems can be found on the Enterprise network as well, but  here they interact with the production process and data. The Microsoft domain controller  at Level 3, Site Operations, should be used to implement a standalone industrial domain  and Active Directory that is in no way tied to the Enterprise domain. Any link from an  Enterprise domain to the Industrial Zone can allow the propagation of attacks or malware  from the Enterprise Zone down into the industrial environment. Level 2 - Area Supervisory Control Many of the functions and systems in level 2 are the same as for level 3 but are targeted  more toward a smaller part or area of the overall system. In this level, specific parts of the  system are being monitored and managed with HMI systems. Think along the lines of a  single machine or skid with a touchscreen HMI to start or stop the machine or skid, and  to see some basic running values and manipulate machine- or skid-specific thresholds and  setpoints.  Systems typically found in level 2 include HMIs (standalone or system clients), supervisory  control systems such as a line-control PLC, engineering workstations, and so on. Level 1 - Basic Control Level 1 is where all the controlling equipment lives. The main purpose of the devices in  this level is to open valves, move actuators, start motors... Typically found in level 1 are  PLCs,  Variable-Frequency Drives  ( VFDs ), dedicated  proportional-integral-derivative ( PID ) controllers, and so on. Although you could find a PLC in level 2, its function there  is of a supervisory nature instead of a controlling one. \n",

The purpose of these systems are to collect and analyze data from sensors in lower-level zones; make decisions on how to execute tasks based on the information gathered by the lower level PLCs/RTUs; and then send commands back down through the communication networks (e.g., RS232, Ethernet) to perform actions at the field device level. DCS systems are used primarily for process control applications in large production facilities where high-speed data processing capabilities are necessary due to complexity of operations being controlled. PLCs and SCADA systems are more often seen as endpoints for monitoring simple processes such as flow rate or temperature that do not require complex computing power.\n",

      "\n",
      "- The IDMZ contains only one level, Level 3.5. This specific level was later added as part of efforts to develop security standards like NIST's Cybersecurity Framework and NERC CIP (North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection).\n",
      "\n",
      "- It acts as an intermediary between levels 4 (business or IT systems) and levels 5 (OT systems), as well as level 3 OT systems. This layer ensures that there is no direct communication path between the more sensitive production/OT systems and less secure business/IT environments, adding a security barrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The IDMZ's role includes relaying communications through broker services to maintain separation and allow for inspection of data in transit. This approach protects lower levels from direct attacks or compromises by shutting down the IDMZ if necessary to contain breaches without interrupting production.\n",

      "The Industrial Zone, which is at the core of ICS:\n",

      "\n",
      "In general, it is quite common for people who have heard about both IT  and OT to make an analogy comparing them. Typical examples of this are: “IT is like Google; you   search for information (like the weather), while OT is a factory that produces cars.” However, as we will discuss in more detail later, these terms do not really have much to do with each other when taken literally.  The truth is that IT and OT represent two different realms of technology altogether. This can be a   bit confusing since many technologies today serve both purposes, so it's hard to draw a sharp line between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of their differing objectives, the underlying equipment, software,  procedures, etc., required for IT and OT are often different too. For example, when we talk about   network media used by IT or OT devices, they have completely different needs based on what those devices do. As a result, you will see that network technologies, such as cables, wireless access points, switches, etc., are designed differently to handle the requirements of both environments;  however, it is still not possible for an IT person or organization to easily work in the OT environment and vice verse since each realm has its own unique characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, there's no hard and fast rule that applies when comparing IT and OT since many   modern technologies are built with both goals in mind. As a result of this overlap, it is very common for companies to use their  network infrastructure as well as their data center operations, etc., across both IT and OT environments at the same time. This allows organizations to maximize cost-efficiency while still   fulfilling both objectives, but even with these overlaps in mind we cannot deny that they are two different technologies with distinct purposes.\n",
      "Answer: Operational Technology (OT) is involved in production activities like getting products out and delivering services, using equipment such as PLCs, HMIs, actuators, sensors, PCs, servers, network switches, and software. Information Technology (IT) encompasses storing, retrieving, and sending information with IT equipment like PCs, servers, network switches, media, firewalls, security appliances, software, firmware, databases. There's an overlap between the two terms when IT equipment is used in OT environments but they are fundamentally different technologies aiming to achieve distinct objectives. Network technologies serve both realms but have design differences based on requirements; however, it remains challenging for professionals of one technology to work effectively in the other due to unique characteristics of each domain. Many modern technologies combine IT and OT goals, allowing organizations to balance cost-efficiency while meeting objectives, despite clear distinctions between IT and OT.\n",
      "Solution=Operational Technology (OT) focuses on production processes such as manufacturing products and delivering services using equipment like PLCs, HMIs, sensors, and software tailored to these functions. In contrast, Information Technology (IT) deals with the management of data through storage, retrieval, and communication, utilizing hardware and software designed for information-related tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two domains have some overlap; IT equipment like servers and network switches may be used within OT environments but their primary roles differ significantly based on industry needs. Despite this overlap, each technology has its own unique objectives, requirements, and challenges in implementation, with professionals often needing specialized knowledge to work effectively within either domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern technologies have blurred the lines between IT and OT by integrating both goals into their infrastructure, enabling companies to efficiently handle diverse operational needs while managing cost-efficiency. However, despite this integration and shared elements, it's important to recognize that Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) are distinct technological domains with different purposes.\n",

      "Where IT and OT truly differ is in the way they are being utilized and implemented.  Whereas IT equipment hardly ever physically controls anything (make something  move; heat up; react...), that is the sole purpose of OT equipment. IT is part of the OT  environment so that there are information capabilities available for the OT processes to  react on, record to, or process changes from. If, on a purely IT system, that data becomes  missing (as a result of corruption or malicious actions), a service might fail, a web portal  might become unresponsive, or some other form of service interruption might occur.  However, the consequences will be limited to some monetary loss, such as missed revenue  or degraded  Service-Level Agreement  ( SLA ) numbers. On the OT side, however, if the  data that a process relies on to properly function goes missing or becomes corrupted, the  physical process can become unstable and the consequences can include physical damage  to the environment or a threat to public health and safety, or can even be deadly for people  operating the machinery that the OT equipment is controlling.  One final difference between IT and OT I want to touch on is the way they are being  protected--the area users of the technology find most important. It is well known that the  security paradigm for IT is the  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability  ( CIA ) triad.  Not strictly a rule, but for IT systems, confidentiality (hiding data from prying eyes) is  the most important factor to secure, followed by integrity (making sure data does not get  tampered with), and the least important asset is availability (uptime). With OT systems,  that triad is turned around--availability is the most important concern of the owners of  an OT system, followed by integrity, and--finally--confidentiality.  The following screenshot depicts the CIA security triad:\n",

      "Figure 1.15 - The CIA security triad\n",
      "\n",
      "What is an ICS?     23\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that some of the processes an OT/ICS system controls are expected to run  flawlessly and uninterrupted for weeks--or even months--at a time, it is easy to see  why here, the availability requirement is king. Integrity is a close second, as we want  to make sure that data that the OT systems and operators are making decisions on is  free from error or manipulation. Confidentiality is hardly a major concern in a typical  OT environment, other than maybe with some historical data stored in a database or  in log files on a server or PC. This is because by the time the data is used, it is pretty  much worthless already; though as I said, stored production data, recipes, and--in some  cases--the control applications that are stored on storage media do have some value, and  therefore the  C  in the CIA triad should not be completely ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did IT and OT convergence occur? Wouldn't it make much more sense to keep the  two separated? Yes--from a security perspective, it would definitely make sense to keep  things as separate as possible. However, from a business perspective, having accurate,  on-the-fly, and relevant data coming from the OT environment makes a lot of sense. Such  information allows tighter production scheduling, can decrease the amount of inventory  that needs to be held on site, helps cost calculation, and provides many more logistical  advantages. Modern ERP and MES systems rely on input and information from both the  production and the enterprise side of a business. Those reasons--and many more--have  driven the convergence of IT and OT systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "The risk\n",
      "The risk\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated earlier in this chapter, the ICS (the OT environment) was originally built with,  and around, proprietary devices, equipment, and networking media and protocols,  without security in mind. Just about every vendor had their own way of doing things, and  every one of them had a different way of configuring, operating, and maintaining their  setup. This proprietary behavior did not work well with the whole IT/OT convergence  demand, and slowly ICS equipment vendors started adhering to a common set of  standards--namely, the widely used networking protocols Ethernet,  Internet Protocol ( IP ),  Transport Control Protocol  ( TCP ), and the  User Datagram Protocol  ( UDP )--to  run their controls and automation protocols over. \n",
      "\n",
      "24     Introduction and Recap of First Edition\n",
      "\n",
      "In order not to have to reinvent the wheel, many vendors layered their well-established  controls and automation protocols on top of the TCP or UDP protocol. This way, all  that was necessary to hop onto the IT/OT convergence train was to slap in an IP/TCP/ UDP-capable communications module, and they were set to go. Seeing as most control  systems are modular in nature, whereby the communications devices are separate from  the  central processing unit  ( CPU ) (controller), this was an easy swap. Now, customers  could more easily adapt to a standard that allowed a common set of technologies to wire  up the entire production facility by the same type of wires, switches, and even the same  skill set of the person doing the install.  And this is what many companies literally did--they wired the entire network, stretching  from the production area, up through the offices, over the  Wide Area Network  ( WAN )  up to other plants or a corporate office, and sometimes even all the way onto the internet.  This made it tremendously easy to get data, troubleshoot,  and gain accessibility, but it  also opened up these previously hidden devices and equipment--often running the most  sensitive parts of a business--to attack. Controls and automation devices now have an IP  address; they can be accessed from anywhere because they use the IP protocol, and they  can be easily interpreted because the controls and automation protocols that ride on top of  IP and TCP are just about all cleartext protocols. Have a look at the following screenshot:\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1.16 - ICS cleartext protocol packet\n",
      "\n",
      "As the preceding screenshot shows, a Modbus packet (for example) does not hide the  data or function codes it is relaying between nodes. This allows for inspection and  manipulation of the data and function codes. Additionally, with the adoption of the TCP/ IP stack of automation equipment, they now can be targeted by common IT techniques  and tools. \n",
      "\n",
      "What is an ICS?     25\n",
      "\n",
      "Even today, most of the ICS equipment is still using the wide open and cleartext protocols  that were designed as part of the proprietary protocol.

      " Ch.11- What is an ICS?        ANSWER      An Industrial Control System (ICS) consists of hardware, software, network  technology, and other devices designed to monitor and manage physical devices in industries such as  manufacturing, power production, or oil & gas exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI=An Industrial Control System (ICS) is a combination of hardware, software, network technologies, and other devices used in industrial environments like manufacturing, energy, and resource sectors to monitor and control physical processes. It typically consists of three main components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Level 0 - Process Level/Equipment Under Control (EUC)**: This is the lowest level where actual process equipment resides. Here, you find devices like motors, pumps, valves, and various sensors measuring critical parameters such as speed, temperature, or pressure. At this level, any disruption can cause significant operational issues since it's directly involved in product creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Market-oriented businesses: These are companies that primarily focus on creating products for sale to consumers based on market demand rather than other objectives (like social impact). While they may contribute positively by addressing consumer needs and preferences, their operations can sometimes prioritize profitability over environmental sustainability or ethical practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **IT and OT Convergence**: Industrial Control Systems have evolved from proprietary, often closed systems to more integrated setups that blur the lines between Operational Technology (OT)—used for production activities like manufacturing and energy management—and Information Technology (IT), which deals with data storage, retrieval, and transmission. This convergence can lead to improved efficiency through technology integration but also introduces new challenges in security and system resilience due to increased complexity and potential vulnerabilities from mixed technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Distinctions Between IT and OT**: Traditionally, Information Technology (IT) focused on managing data-centric processes like software development, cybersecurity, and network management. In contrast, Operational Technology (OT), a key component of an Industrial Control System (ICS), is concerned with controlling physical devices in the industrial context, including Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), sensors, actuators, and related software. However, as IT processes are integrated into OT environments for enhanced capabilities, such as remote monitoring and control, these boundaries have become less distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, an ICS is a sophisticated blend of hardware and software designed to monitor and manage industrial operations efficiently. The convergence of IT and OT within this framework has brought about significant improvements in operational efficiency but also introduced complexities in ensuring the security and reliability of these systems. Market-oriented businesses, while essential for economic development, may not always align with environmental or social objectives without conscious effort to balance profitability with sustainability initiatives.\n",
      ": The world is rapidly changing, which means that threats are  also evolving along with it. While most companies still haven't realized this yet (or simply don't want to), the   need for increased security in both the physical and digital realms has been proven by many incidents throughout history. This was mentioned earlier when we discussed how a breach on an OT system, or even one that affects just  data from it, can have potentially fatal consequences. The reason I mention this again is because not only does increased security in the IT world bring us better protection and   resilience against cyber attacks, but it also has benefits to physical processes when  integrated properly with OT equipment. This synergy between IT and OT allows for more effective monitoring of OT processes via their digital counterparts that allow for greater transparency and control over these processes. Increasing security in both the OT/ICS environment and the   IT world has never been more important--both can be affected by a lack of it, and with threats  continuing to evolve at an increasing rate, staying one step ahead is becoming extremely difficult for many organizations.\n",
      "===\n",
      "The text introduces the differences between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), their roles in environments where they coexist, security considerations specific to each, and reasons behind their convergence. It explains how IT primarily deals with data management and control through digital means, rarely physically controlling anything, whereas OT focuses on the direct control of physical processes. The text highlights that while an issue within an IT system might cause service disruptions or financial losses, issues in OT can lead to severe consequences including physical harm to people, environmental damage, and threats to public health.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CIA security triad is introduced for IT systems—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—and then the priorities are reversed for OT/ICS systems, where Availability takes precedence due to the need for uninterrupted operation in critical physical processes. However, Integrity remains important to ensure data accuracy for decision-making, while Confidentiality is less of a concern unless the stored information has value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text further explores why IT and OT systems are converging, mentioning business benefits such as better production scheduling, inventory management, and cost calculation that result from real-time data sharing between these two domains. However, it acknowledges the increased risks in today's rapidly evolving threat landscape, emphasizing the importance of heightened security measures to protect both digital and physical processes. Integration of IT and OT is seen as a strategic move for enhanced monitoring and control over operational processes, ensuring resilience against cyberattacks and safeguarding critical infrastructrances.\n",

      "In this illustration you can see that many of these devices are IP accessible, with one exception. See Figure  3.4 . This is our firewall, and it has been configured to block all incoming traffic except from the production facility's internal  WAN link (connected to another plant or corporate office) and a few exceptions for outgoing data  originating in this facility that need to reach an external destination (Internet access). However, even with these measures in  place, we are still exposed. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If the firewall is not properly configured to block all unsolicited incoming requests from  3 . The production equipment and devices can be attacked directly via the public Internet if they have been misconfigured (which    they probably will), or a malicious actor has found a way around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "- One might think that the firewall is protecting everything, but in reality many of these control and automation protocols still run  over common network media, such as Ethernet (see Figure  3.6 ) . As soon as they have access to an open port on one of the internal equipment devices, it would be possible for attackers to send malicious requests through that port by using a compromised system inside the corporate network or directly from Internet  space and targeting vulnerable IP-enabled control units in this production facility.\n",

      "\n",
      "Another risk with open protocols, such as those mentioned above (Modbus RTU, Modbus TCP/IP, Profinet), is that it is very easy to sniff  traffic on the network using a cheap packet analyzer tool. In fact, I am willing to bet that if you look at your  3 . You will find plenty of such devices. With these tools in their hands and knowledge about how things work inside this facility (not always necessary), attackers could easily sniff out sensitive information on the network and cause trouble with  equipment malfunctioning or worse.\n",
      "- Internal traffic from production equipment to controllers can be intercepted, analyzed for vulnerabilities, and used later as  3 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem is that if an ICS network has been built over time using various pieces of equipment, it will often have multiple protocols in use at the same time.  This increases the risk because attackers could try to exploit different devices on their own terms while being unaware of other targets within the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion:\n",
      "- An open ICS network exposes critical information and control systems to internal and external attacks, increasing vulnerabilities and potential impacts of malicious activity.\n",

      "\n",
      "As we have seen in this chapter, traditional IT/OT convergence was done with proprietary devices that were not designed to be secure by default. However, over the last 15 years or so, there has been a huge push toward converging IT and OT environments using common protocols such as Ethernet, Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Packet (UDP). Although this convergence opens up opportunities for more efficient operations and easier maintenance, it also exposes ICS networks to potential vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open communication between different devices within an IT/OT system creates various risks:\n",
      "- Exposing sensitive data through open network protocols like Modbus RTU or TCP can lead to information theft by attackers who have managed to gain access.\n",
      "- Interception of network traffic allows attackers to analyze and potentially exploit vulnerabilities, leading to equipment malfunction or deliberate disruption of operations.\n",
      "- Inconsistent implementation of protocols across different systems may result in multiple vectors for an attacker to target devices that are running various communication standards within the same infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these risks:\n",
      "- Network segregation is a possible mitigation technique, where production equipment and critical control networks are physically separated from regular IT networks through firewalled environments. While this helps prevent certain types of attacks originating externally (e.g., via the Internet), it may not be sufficient alone due to potential internal threats or unprotected devices within the firewall's reach.\n",
      "- Adopting network security best practices and monitoring tools is essential for identifying and mitigating risks in real time, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.\n",
      "- Regular software updates and patch management should be prioritized to close any known vulnerabilities in control systems and automation equipment.\n",
      "- Network traffic analysis can help identify unusual or suspicious activity that may indicate a potential cyber threat or insider attack, allowing for quicker detection and response.\n",

      "From a high-level perspective, we will now look at the steps the attackers took to reach  their objective. Reconnaissance  The first step for an attacker is to gather as much information about their target as  possible. This is called reconnaissance. Here, the attackers learned as much as they could  about the operation of the papermill, the personal life of its employees, and the technology  used in the ICS environment before they started their attack. Spear phishing  The attackers crafted an enticing phishing email that they tailored in such a way as to get  Mark to click on a malicious link that would ultimately compromise the computer Mark was  logged in on, allowing the attackers to take a foothold on the papermill's enterprise network. You can see the phishing email here:\n",

Lateral movement on the Enterprise network Once the attackers had a foothold on the Enterprise network of the papermill (the  network that directly connects to the internet and has business-type clients with email and  internet access on it), they started looking around for additional systems to compromise.  They did this by using Mark's computer as a pivot into the network and running their  probes and scans that way.  Using this method, they found and compromised other interesting computers, and  ultimately made their way onto a system that due to being \"dual homed\" (connected to  two networks: the enterprise network and the industrial network) allowed them access to  the industrial environment.\n",

They achieved this objective by manipulating the cleartext packets sent from the control  process to the operator screen.
